# my-calcofi

This repository contains Python code for analyzing the CalCOFI dataset. The CalCOFI dataset includes the longest (1949-today) and most comprehensive (over 50,000 sampling stations) time-series of oceanographic and larval fish data in the world. The dataset includes data on the abundance of larvae of over 250 fish species; data on the frequency of larval length and abundance of eggs on key commercial species; and oceanographic and plankton data. The physical, chemical, and biological data collected at regular intervals of time and space have become rapidly valuable for documenting climatic cycles in the California Current and a series of biological responses to them.

The objective of this project is to answer the following questions by analyzing and creating one or more predictive models, using various algorithms seen in class (decision tree regressor, linear regression, etc.) based on the available data and on a subset of the first 500 rows:

Is there a relationship between water salinity and water temperature? Justify your answer with the output of your predictive model.
Can you predict the water temperature based on salinity?
